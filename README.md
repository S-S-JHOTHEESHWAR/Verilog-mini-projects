# Verilog-mini-projects
This is a repository for the mini projects that i did for learning verilog

Tools used : xilinx vivado

The repo includes :

   -Design Files

   -Testbench Files (verilog simualtion files)

   -RTL schematic (generated by xilinx vivado)

   -Verified waveform 


4x4 multiplier : designed a 4bit * 4bit multiplier using structutral modelling using standard way of multiplication , used half adders and full adders

CLA : to overcome the delay of carry propogation in ripple carry adder CLA helps in carry generation which saves time

ALU : built a basic ALU which can do addition, subtractaction, and operation, or operation, complement, XOR, increment and decrement

traffic light FSM : one of the easy way to learn FSM , 00 represent red, 01 - yellow, 10 - red . the lights are placed in a cross roads , the light changes for every 10 clock cycles
